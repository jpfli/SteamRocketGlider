# Flight of the Steam Rocket Glider
This is a simple little game where you control a steam rocket powered airplane, trying to fly as far as possible with a limited amount of steam energy. The challenge is to find favourable winds to help you stay in the air longer. Yes, thanks to the ultra realistic aerodynamic simulation, you can exploit rising air currents to gain altitude while avoiding winds that push you down towards ground.
